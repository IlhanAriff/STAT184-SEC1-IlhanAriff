# STAT184-HW-Template
 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template

Introduction : The purpose of this repository is to learn how to utilize github and basic template on presenting a code that has been developed. 
In this case, I will be using a code used from one of my past assignments in the class STAT184.

Implementation : In the code, I developed a method on how to solve the challenges required by the diamonds dataset while trying to use the
least amount of lines possible. Using library(ggplot2) and library(dplyr) I was able to use multiple methods to make this feat possible such as
group_by(), summarize() to standardize and calculate results in the diamonds dataset.

Results Or Conclusion : The result given is the table that addresses each of the diamond in the diamonds dataset. The table prevents information
regarding the carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, and the dimensions x, y, and z of the diamond. This table presented from the code
can be used to make conclusions such as what cut and dimensions determine a higher diamond price or how much carat determines a higher price.

Contact : For questions regarding the code, please contact my email : ivs5271@psu.edu so we can discuss further.
